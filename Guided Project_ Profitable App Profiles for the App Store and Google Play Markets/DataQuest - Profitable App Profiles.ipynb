    "In this guided project, we work with two sets of mobile app data -- one from the iOS App Store and one from the Android Google Play Store -- in order to understand what types of of apps are likely to attract the most users. Our focus will be on free apps that are targeted at an English-speaking audience. More specifically, we will be exploring the most common and the most popular free apps by genre to see if there are any app genres which are particularly popular. While this project was originally written in pure Python, we will instead make use of the usual Python data science packages: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are over four million apps available between the two major mobile app stores, we will work with samples from each that have been collected and uploaded to Kaggle. The first sample is a [set of approximately 10,000 Google Play Store apps](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) that was scraped in February 2019. The second is a [set of approximately 7200 iOS App Store apps](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) that was scraped in June 2018."

    "Ideally, we'd be able to choose which of the above two rows by comparing when each was scraped and then picking the row which was scraped more recently to keep. Unfortunately, this dataset does not explicitly contain that information. We can, however, use the values in the `reviews` column as a proxy. The row with more reviews will be the one that was scraped more recently. To have pandas handle this process, we first sort the dataframe by the `reviews` column in descending order and then use the [`drop_duplicates()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop_duplicates.html) to drop the duplicate rows. By default, the `drop_duplicates()` function keeps the first occurence of each duplicated row, so by sorting them in descending order by the number of reviews we will be able to keep the row with the most reviews (i.e. the row which was scraped most recently) for each duplicated app. Before sorting by the number reviews, we need to cast the `reviews` column to integers, since correcting the entry for Life Made WI-Fi Touchscreen Photo Frame resulted in putting a float into that column while the rest of the values are currently stored as strings. Strings and floats are not comparable to each other, so we would encounter an error if we do not convert the `reviews` column."

One way that we can focus on apps targeted toward English-speaking audiences is by filtering out apps with names that use non-English characters. A naive way of doing this would be to use the built-in [`str.isascii()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isascii) to filter out all apps which use non-ASCII characters."

To minimize the potential impact of data loss from this aggressive filtering strategy, we will instead filter out apps titles with a number of non-ASCII characters that exceeds a given threshold. The first step in implementing this less-aggressive strategy is to write a function that counts the number of non-ASCII characters in a string. This will make use of the [`ord()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord), which converts a character into its Unicode code point."

    "We also see that the values in the `installs` column aren't exact numbers of installs. Instead, they are order-of-magnitude estimates such as 100+ install or 1,000,000+ installs. This is important to note, since an app with an `installs` value of 1,000,000+ could have anywhere from as few as exactly 1,000,000 istalls to as many as 4,999,999 installs. However, since we are trying to examine overall popularity trends for various app genres, this data is sufficient for our purposes. \n",

    "In order to perform computations with this column, we will need to convert the strings into integers. To do so, we will assume that the number of installs for each app will be at the bottom of the range indicated by the value in the `installs` column. For example, we will simply convert a value of 100+ to just 100. This conversion will happen in two steps. First, we use the [`pandas.Series.str.replace()` function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.replace.html#pandas.Series.str.replace) to strip out all of the \"+\" and \",\" characters that occur. The second step is to use the [`pandas.to_numeric()` function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_numeric.html#pandas.to_numeric) to convert those values from strings to a numeric data type (either ints or floats depending on the context).

    "As we can see, the Communication category has the highest mean number of installs (about 38.5 million), with Video Players (about 24.7 million) in second place and Social (about 23.3 million) in third. However, each of these categories have extremely high standard deviations: 156 million, 119 million, and 121 million, respectively, which seems to indicate that those categories each contain apps which are huge outliers in terms of popularity. In comparision, the medians for each category, which are much more resistant to outliers, are 500,000, 1,000,000, and 100,000 for Communication, Video Players, and Social, respectively. These values are much more modest in comparison to the mean values, and they provide a picture of the popularity of a typical app in each of those categories that isn't as skewed by the large outliers. An ambitious hypothetical app developer might still want to target one of those categories, since the high mean number of installs is an indicator of the large potential demand, but they would face stiff competition from the already-existing apps that dominate each category. This is especially true of the Communication and Social categories due to the extremely strong influence of [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) for the established players. It would take a lot of resources to even have a chance at competing with the most popular existing apps, and the chances of successfully doing so are slim. Before discussing an alternative strategy for how a more cautious hypothetical app developer with fewer resources at their disposal might choose a category to explore, we'll take a closer look at the top ten apps from each of the three most popular categories."
