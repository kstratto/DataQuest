    "In this guided project, we work with two sets of mobile app data -- one from the iOS App Store and one from the Android Google Play Store -- in order to understand what types of of apps are likely to attract the most users. Our focus will be on free apps that are targeted at an English-speaking audience. While this project was originally written in pure Python, we will instead make use of the usual Python data science packages: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are over four million apps available between the two major mobile app stores, we will work with samples from each that have been collected and uploaded to Kaggle. The first sample is a [set of approximately 10,000 Google Play Store apps](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) that was scraped in February 2019. The second is a [set of approximately 7200 iOS App Store apps](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) that was scraped in June 2018."
