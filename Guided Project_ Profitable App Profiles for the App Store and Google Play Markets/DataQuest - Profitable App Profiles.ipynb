    "In this guided project, we work with two sets of mobile app data -- one from the iOS App Store and one from the Android Google Play Store -- in order to understand what types of of apps are likely to attract the most users. Our focus will be on free apps that are targeted at an English-speaking audience. More specifically, we will be exploring the most common and the most popular free apps by genre to see if there are any app genres which are particularly popular. While this project was originally written in pure Python, we will instead make use of the usual Python data science packages: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are over four million apps available between the two major mobile app stores, we will work with samples from each that have been collected and uploaded to Kaggle. The first sample is a [set of approximately 10,000 Google Play Store apps](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) that was scraped in February 2019. The second is a [set of approximately 7200 iOS App Store apps](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) that was scraped in June 2018."

    "Ideally, we'd be able to choose which of the above two rows by comparing when each was scraped and then picking the row which was scraped more recently to keep. Unfortunately, this dataset does not explicitly contain that information. We can, however, use the values in the `reviews` column as a proxy. The row with more reviews will be the one that was scraped more recently. To have pandas handle this process, we first sort the dataframe by the `reviews` column in descending order and then use the [`drop_duplicates()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop_duplicates.html) to drop the duplicate rows. By default, the `drop_duplicates()` function keeps the first occurence of each duplicated row, so by sorting them in descending order by the number of reviews we will be able to keep the row with the most reviews (i.e. the row which was scraped most recently) for each duplicated app. Before sorting by the number reviews, we need to cast the `reviews` column to integers, since correcting the entry for Life Made WI-Fi Touchscreen Photo Frame resulted in putting a float into that column while the rest of the values are currently stored as strings. Strings and floats are not comparable to each other, so we would encounter an error if we do not convert the `reviews` column."

One way that we can focus on apps targeted toward English-speaking audiences is by filtering out apps with names that use non-English characters. A naive way of doing this would be to use the built-in [`str.isascii()` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isascii) to filter out all apps which use non-ASCII characters."

To minimize the potential impact of data loss from this aggressive filtering strategy, we will instead filter out apps titles with a number of non-ASCII characters that exceeds a given threshold. The first step in implementing this less-aggressive strategy is to write a function that counts the number of non-ASCII characters in a string.

Looking at the output from the `unique()` function tells us that this is due to the fact the column contains strings which are used to represent numerical ranges."

    "We also see that the values in the `installs` column aren't exact numbers of installs. Instead, they are order-of-magnitude estimates such as 100+ install or 1,000,000+ installs. This is important to note, since an app with an `installs` value of 1,000,000+ could have anywhere from as few as exactly 1,000,000 istalls to as many as 4,999,999 installs. However, since we are trying to examine overall popularity trends for various app genres, this data is sufficient for our purposes. \n",

    "In order to perform computations with this column, we will need to convert the strings into integers. To do so, we will assume that the number of installs for each app will be at the bottom of the range indicated by the value in the `installs` column. For example, we will simply convert a value of 100+ to just 100. This conversion will happen in two steps. First, we use the [`pandas.Series.str.replace()` function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.replace.html#pandas.Series.str.replace) to strip out all of the \"+\" and \",\" characters that occur. The second step is to use the [`pandas.to_numeric()` function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_numeric.html#pandas.to_numeric) to convert those values from strings to a numeric data type (either ints or floats depending on the context). We will then replace the original `installs` column with the converted version."
